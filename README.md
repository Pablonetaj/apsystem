# homeassistant-apsystems_ecur
This is a custom component for [Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io) that adds support for the APSystems ECU-R solar Energy Communication Unit [APsystems](http://www.apsystems.com). With this component you are able to monitor your PV installation (inverters) in detail.


## Background & acknowledgement
This integration queries the local ECU-R every 1 minute for new data. This was done without a public API, and by listening to and interpreting the protocol the APSystems ECU phone app (ECUapp) uses when setting up the PV array.

This couldn't have been done without the hardwork of @checking12 and @HAEdwin on the home assistant forum, and all the other people from this forum (https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/2032302/1)

## Prerequisites
You own an APSystems ECU-R and any combination of YC600, YC1000 or QS1 inverter.
This component only works if the ECU-R is attached to your network by Wifi. To enable and configure WiFi on the ECU-R, use the ECUapp (downloadable via Appstore or Google Play) and temporarily enable the ECU-R's accesspoint by pressing the button on the side of the ECU-R. Then connect your phone's WiFi to the ECU-R's accesspoint to enable the ECUapp to connect and configure the ECU-R.
Although there's no need to also attach the ECU-R by ethernet cable, you are free to do so if you like.

Release notes
v1.0.0 First release
v1.0.1 Revised the readme, added support for YC1000 (hopefully) and added versioning to the manifest
```

## Setup
Copy contents of the apsystems_ecur/ directory into your <HA-CONFIG>/custom_components/apsystems_ecur directory (```/config/custom_components``` on hassio)

Your directory structure should look like this:
```
   config/custom_components/apsystems_ecur/__init__.py
   config/custom_components/apsystems_ecur/const.py
   config/custom_components/apsystems_ecur/sensor.py
   config/custom_components/apsystems_ecur/APSysstemsECUR.py
   config/custom_components/apsystems_ecur/manifest.json
```

## Configuration
Add the following snippet into your ```configuration.yaml```  replace [IPADDR] with the WiFi connected IP address of your ECU-R device. 

```

apsystems_ecur:
    host: [IPADDR]

```

## Data available
The component supports getting data from the array as a whole as well as each individual invertor.

### Array Level Sensors
* sensor.ecu_current_power - total amount of power (in W) being generated right now
* sensor.ecu_today_energy - total amount of energy (in kWh) generated today now
* sensor.ecu_lifetime_energy - total amount of energy (in kWh) generated from the lifetime of the array

### Inverter Level Sensors
There will be this set of sensors for every inverter you have in your system, UID will be replaced by the UID of the inverter discovered

* sensor.inverter_[UID]_frequency - the AC power frequency in Hz
* sensor.inverter_[UID]_voltage - the AC voltage in V
* sensor.inverter_[UID]_temperature - the temperature of the invertor in your local unit (C or F)
* sensor.inverter_[UID]_signal - the signal strength of the zigbee connection
* sensor.inverter_[UID]_power_ch_[1-4] - the current power generation (in W) of each channel of the invertor - number of channels will depend on inverter model

## TODO
1. Code cleanup - it probably needs some work
